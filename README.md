# Customised-Arduino-
Custom Arduino-compatible PCB project using ATmega328P which includes motor control, 7-segment display, and power supply design
It was developed as part of a course I took from Internshala.

## Project Details

**Project Name:** Customised Arduino

**Software Used:**  - Altium Designer

**Tutorial Reference:**  
This project was developed as part of a course from [Internshala](https://internshala.com/).

**Design Files:**  
- [Schematic]
- [PCB Layout] 
- [3D Model]

## Features

- Powered by a 7805 voltage regulator converting 12V to 5V  
- Controls two small DC motors using the L293D motor driver IC  
- Motor speed can be controlled both via computer commands and manually using a potentiometer on the board  
- Seven-segment display driven by the CD4511BE driver IC, showing numbers 0-9  
- One RGB LED controlled by both the microcontroller and a simple switch on the board
